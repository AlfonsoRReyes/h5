Description: h5 provides an interface to the HDF5 API through S4-objects.
    It supports fast storage and retrieval of R-objects like vectors, matrices
    and arrays to binary files in a language independent format. The package
    can therefore be used as an alternative to R's save/load mechanism. Since
    h5 is able to access only subsets of stored data it can also handle data
    sets which do not fit into memory.
